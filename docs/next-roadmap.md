# AgentOS Next Roadmap

Status: Current

## Phase 1 Closed

Phase 1 is closed as:

> AgentOS OS-native agent runtime prototype

Phase 1 established the shape of AgentOS:

- terminal-first operator surface
- bundled local LLM baseline
- `agentos-kernelctl` capability and proof surfaces
- Telegram setup/reply experiments
- intent-aware dispatch direction
- activity-feed substrate for “AgentOS narrates its work”
- local ARM64 ISO build and VM experimentation path

Phase 1 is not a production-ready operating system release. It is the proof that the OS-native agent runtime direction is worth productizing.

## Phase 2 Goal

Phase 2 should turn the prototype into a local-first Codex runtime loop:

```text
local or booted AgentOS runtime
-> configure local-first runtime adapters
-> receive a user prompt
-> classify intent
-> run a bounded capability
-> narrate progress
-> store user-visible records
-> reply or recover clearly
```

The detailed Phase 2 roadmap is tracked in
`docs/roadmap/phase2-local-first-runtime-loop.md`.

## Phase 2 Priority Work

1. **Golden runtime loop acceptance**
   - Define the repeatable proof before broad implementation.
   - Cover setup, prompt intake, intent classification, capability dispatch, activity narration, records, reply, and recovery.

2. **Docker runtime preview**
   - Docker should be a developer/demo runtime preview, not the product target.
   - It should prove the runtime loop without claiming boot, installer, VM recovery, or ISO freshness proof.

3. **User-owned runtime data**
   - Shared folders and bind mounts should expose user-owned records, outputs, logs, diagnostics, and acceptance artifacts.
   - Secrets must stay outside plaintext shared user data.

4. **Intent classification contract**
   - Prompt intent classification should be a runtime contract before capability dispatch.
   - Low-confidence, destructive, external-send, or lifecycle-changing requests should require clarification or confirmation.

5. **Everyday work capabilities**
   - Prove bounded AgentOS status/recovery, workspace files, web/search, and Gmail read/search/summarize/draft flows.
   - Calendar should begin read-only if it fits the Phase 2 slice.

6. **Activity feed, records, and recovery**
   - Every request should show received, classified, running, completed, replied, or failed.
   - Raw JSON and parser traces should be hidden behind logs.
   - Records/retrieval should be framed as a searchable user-owned work archive, not a complete second brain.

## Later Tracks

- verified boot and hardware attestation
- updater hardening
- broader app/inbox ecosystem
- richer browser fallback
- distribution packaging
- public preview operations
